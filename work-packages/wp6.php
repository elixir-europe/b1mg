        <p class="mt-6">The goals of this WP are to implement the B1MG management structure and to oversee the project execution, ensuring effective and efficient coordination to deliver the project goals and expected impact within time, scope and budget.</p>
        <p> The B1MG management structure purposely aligns with the 1+MG initiative establishing the basis for an effective and efficient management of the initiative in the long term. In addition, we aim to define long term sustainability models for the components of the framework as well as for the actual implementation. Guidelines and recommendations on how to establish national mirror groups will be produced to promote uptake of the different recommendations at the national level.</p>
        <h2 class="mb-2 mt-55">Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="mt-2 xbp">
          <li><strong>O6.1:</strong> Establish the project governance structure mobilising the project resources and developing the project guidance (Task 6.1).</li>
          <li><strong>O6.2:</strong> Efficient and effective project monitoring collecting KPIs and tracking risk and opportunities to assist the project boards on taking informed decisions at all levels (Task 6.2).</li>
          <li><strong>O6.3:</strong> Develop and update the project data management plan along the project life cycle (Task 6.3).</li>

            <p> Monitoring activities will also be included in all meetings from impact KPIs to technical delivery metrics (deliverables and milestones), quality assurance, risks, opportunities and innovation management (identification of assets).</p>

        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <div>
            <p>Mirror groups are a national reflection of the working groups set up by the 1+MG Initiative. The idea is that they nurture the work of the main working groups and translate the goals of the Declaration into each country. Due to the differences among countries, both in terms of research and innovation and health systems governance and in terms of approaches with respect to the 1+MG initiative, mirror groups are set up in different configurations.</p>
            <p>This task will enable a mutual learning exercise and will help to fine tune the work of the different mirror groups. Moreover, it will help observer countries and those who have not yet joined the initiative to see how to step into the initiative in a structured and effective way or to set up their own structure.</p>
            <p>To this aim, we will first analyse the different existing mirror groups, and assess its structure, composition, governance and operating modes. We will survey mirror group components on the benefits/obstacles encountered and compare against the work delivered by the related working group. Finally, we will take advantage of country visits and workshops organised in WP5, together with the 1M Genome working groups meetings â€“ in particular WG1 - to promote a mutual learning exercise between those individuals invited to participate.</p>
            <p>With this feedback, we will set up some guiding principles and identify best practices for the good set-up, running and coordination of mirror groups. </p>

        <div class="accordion-panel">
          <div>
            <p>Long-term sustainability of the 1+MG initiative will require an appropriate organisational structure and plan. The Governing Board of B1MG, formed by representatives designated by the signing and observer countries (as well as countries not currently involved in the initiative) will be crucial to this aim.</p>
            <p>Through this task and with the B1MG Governing Board, potential legal and financial frameworks for developing the initiative at international level will be explored together with its insertion/ institution as a major contributor to future initiatives (i.e. Partnership for Personalised Medicine, Mission on Cancer).</p>
            <p>The task will define the structure of a sustainability plan central to the future development of the initiative. This plan will be developed with the participation of the organisations involved in Task 5.4 plus those required to assess the structural aspects of sustainability, i.e. financial and operational ones as well as scientific excellence and leadership. It will be presented to the B1MG Governing Board.</p>
            <p> It will identify potential funding needs â€“ both at national and European level according to different scenarios for the following years as well as enabling flexibility to enlarge the initiative. The sustainability model will analyse complementary existing initiatives and strategic partnerships to maximise the impact of the project. In this frame, and back to back with WP5, policy briefs will be prepared to inform relevant authorities and other stakeholders about the progress, enlargement, sustainability and future development plans of the 1+MG initiative. </p>
