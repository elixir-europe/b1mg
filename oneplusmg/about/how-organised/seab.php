        <p>The Scientific and Ethics Advisory Board (SEAB) support the <a href="/about/how-organised/governing-board">Governing Board</a>, and are consulted on the progress of the B1MG project.</p>
        <p>The SEAB consists of international experts not directly involved in the B1MG project. They meet once a year face-to-face at the General Assembly, and virtually when required. The B1MG consortium may incorporate additional experts, to ensure the delivery of project objectives, but any proposal need to be approved by the  Governing Board.</p>
