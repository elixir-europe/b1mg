        <p>The 1+ Million Genomes initiative has the potential to improve disease prevention, allow for more personalised treatments and support groundbreaking research.
        </p>
          <p>The '1+ Million Genomes' (1+MG) initiative aims to enable secure access to genomics and the corresponding clinical data across Europe for better research, personalised healthcare and health policymaking. Since the Digital Day 2018, 24 EU countries, the UK and Norway signed Member States’ declaration on stepping up efforts towards creating a European data infrastructure for genomic data and implementing common national rules enabling federated data access. The initiative forms part of the EU’s agenda for the Digital Transformation of Health and Care and is aligned with the goals of the European Health Data Space.</p>

        <h3 class="">Better health and treatments for illnesses</h3>
        <p>Researchers and clinicians will be able to compare people's genetic and clinical information at the same time. This will help them detect illnesses earlier, predict the development of disease, and decide on the best ways to improve health.</p>

        <h3 class="">Economic benefits</h3>
        <p>Improvements in personalised medicine will make national health systems more efficient and cost-effective, and new insights into how genes affect a person's response to a drug will stimulate innovation and new products across the healthcare industry.</p>
