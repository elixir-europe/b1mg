    <p>The <strong>B1MG Maturity Level Model (MLM)</strong> aims to promote and facilitate the adoption of genomics
            by healthcare
            systems for making personalised medicine accessible to citizens and patients across Europe.</p>
        <p>Experts from the B1MG project developed the MLM framework to enable all interested countries to self evaluate
            the level of maturity of national genomic medicine practices following a common matrix.</p>
