                    <p>The Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG) project aims to make it easier to share genomics data across borders within Europe. It supports the EU's 1+ Million Genomes Initiative (1+MG) by bringing together diverse stakeholders from scientific and technical communities, international initiatives, projects, national healthcare systems, as well as industry to collectively create the infrastructure, the legal guidance and the best practices to enable this access. To facilitate this process, the efforts of 1+MG/B1MG have also included increasing the engagement, awareness and alignment of the different stakeholders involved in the genomics-based research and healthcare landscape within Europe.</p>
                    <p>Being the last stakeholder forum organised by the B1MG project, this meeting will centre on identifying how stakeholders could contribute to the scale up and sustainability of the B1MG efforts.</p>

                    <p>Along with updates on progress to date (the 1+MG Trust Framework, the Maturity Level Model and industry engagement), highlights of the the day will include a panel discussion on industry engagement and parallel workshops to consider scale up and sustainability in the context of rare disease, cancer, common complex disease and infectious disease.</p>

                    <p>Serena is the Head of Human Genomics and Translational Data at ELIXIR, the European infrastructure for bioinformatics and life-science data, based in Hinxton, UK. Her vision is to ensure data that can be shared, will be shared responsibly. She is working with scientists across Europe to establish standards and infrastructure to facilitate discoverability, access, sharing and analysis of genomics data, linked to other data types and at a scale that has not previously been achieved.
                    </p>
                    <p>Developing infrastructure will unleash new possibilities for genomics and health. Serena is the coordinator of the B1MG project, a €4M EU H2020 Coordination and Support Action and an upcoming €40M EU H2020 Genomic Data Infrastructure project that are both aligned with the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative (1+MG), which she also co-chairs. This initiative is a commitment of 24 European countries to give cross-border access to one million sequenced genomes. She is also project lead for the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) FAIRplus project, an €8.3M collaboration that sets out to improve data sharing and reuse in life science research.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6"> Prior to joining ELIXIR, she was a Director within the Human Genetics and Computational Biomedicine group at Pfizer. In this role, she led and implemented a genetic and precision medicine strategy to support drug target selection and clinical programmes for the Pain and Sensory Disorders Research Unit.
